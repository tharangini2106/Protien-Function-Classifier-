# Protien-Function-Classifier-
Machine learning prediction

SUMMARY :

we will gonna solve the protein function classifier.In this we are doing fours steps processing the data, loading the data, testing and training the data and finally we will get our model.

ABOUT THIS PROJECT :

Proteins play important roles in living organisms, and their function is directly linked with their structure. Due to the growing gap between the number of proteins being discovered and their functional characterization in particular as a result of experimental limitations, reliable prediction of protein function through computational means has become crucial.

Step 1 : What are we gonna solve?
Step 2 : Preprocessing Data 
Step 3 : Load the data and Getting the shape of the data
Step 4 : Testing Training
Step 5 : Shapes in depth 
Step 6 : Sequential Model 
Step 7 : Functional Model
